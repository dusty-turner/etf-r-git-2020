## Topics & Class Structure

1. Git/GitHub setup and repository download (~45 minutes; interactive)
2. Ten-minute break
3. Using R for modeling with differential equations (~30 minutes; interactive)
4. Collaboration using Git (as time allows; instructor demonstration)



## Software Prerequisites

1. R 3.6.x or newer
2. RStudio 1.2.x or newer
3. Git 
4. Git Bash (included with Git for Windows) or another command-line application of your choice capable of using Git
5. A github account [github website](https://github.com)

## Human Prerequisites

We assume you have:

1. Working knowledge of R and RStudio;
2. Some experience with contemporary tidy coding concepts;
3. A need to work collaboratively on projects;
4. A healthy appreciation of dad jokes.

Try to follow along, at least through the differential equation section. It's okay to struggle to keep up with certain parts of this - we'll do our best to help you, but we also won't be offended if you decide to leave.

## Distance Learning Challenges

1. Don't be afraid to ask questions - both verbally and in chat.
2. If you miss something we said, it's likely others have too - you'll be helping them by speaking up.
3. Its difficult the know the speed of the class, so please communicate!

## Endstate

1. You have git configured on your computer;
2. You have linked git to github;
3. You have a repo cloned to your computer;
4. You can push, pull, and merge git conflicts in the repository;
5. You've learned the basics of using differential equations in R.
