## Introduction

We take a quick pause from our git introduction to talk about differential equations in R.

R is best known as a statistical coding language. However, it is often important to incorporate other tools into your workflow to support statistical modeling.

## deSolve

We will rely on the r package `deSolve`, an R wrapper to the [FORTRAN ODE solver](https://rdrr.io/cran/deSolve/man/lsoda.html).

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("deSolve")
library(deSolve)
```


```{r, warning = F, message = F, include=F}
library(deSolve)
```

As always, we'll also use tools from the `tidyverse`.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, warning = F, message = F, include=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Steps to solving differential equations with deSolve

1. Define your first order differential equations
2. Define parameters governing the differential equations
3. Define initial conditions
4. Define time step
5. Solve differential equations

## Real world example: SEIR 

In epidemiology, the SEIR equations model the spread of a disease through a population.  

The S, E, I, and R represent four distinct population bins:

* S: Susceptible
* E: Exposed
* I: Infected
* R: Removed

A set of four differential equations govern a population's movement through these four bins.

![](img/seir.png)

$\beta$: Infectiousness rate - probability of transmitting disease from an infectious individual to a susceptible individual  

$\sigma$: 1 / time from exposure to infectiousness (i.e., time spent in "E" bin)  

$\gamma$: 1 / time from infectiousness to recovery (i.e., time spent in "I" bin)  

## SEIR Differential Equations using deSolve in R

In order to solve a system of differential equations, we will work to provide all the elements of the `lsoda()` function from the `deSolve` library.

```{r, eval=F}
sol <- lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode, parms = par)
```

`y`: The initial values for the ODE syetem

`times`: Times at which excplicit estimates for `y` are desired.

`func`: R-function that computes the values of the derivatives in the ODE system (the model definition) at time t.  

`parms`: vector or list of parameters used in `func` 


### Define Initial Conditions

```{r}
iNot <- 1/1000 # proportion of population that is infected on day 1
eNot <- 1/100 # proportion of population that is exposed but not yet infected on day 1
rNot <- 0 # proportion of population that is removed on day 1
sNot <- 1 - iNot - eNot - rNot # proportion of population that is susceptible on day 1

init<-c(sNot,eNot,iNot)
```

### Define Time Steps

```{r}
t<-seq(0,365)
```

### Define the Ordinary Differential Equations

```{r}
seir_ode <- function(t,Y,par){

  S<-Y[1] # Suseptible
  E<-Y[2] # Exposed 
  I<-Y[3] # Infected
  
  beta<-par[1] # this takes the first slot from the vector par that is passed in - it changes every time
  sigma<-par[2] # this takes the second slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  gamma<-par[3] # this takes the third slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  # mu<-par[4] # this takes the third slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  
  dYdt<-vector(length=3)  ## this creates an empty vector of length 3
  dYdt[1]=-beta*I*S ## this is the formula for the suseptible population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[2]=beta*I*S-sigma*E ## this is the formula for the exposed population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[3]=sigma*E-gamma*I ## this is the formula for the infected population after the first step of the SEIR
  
  return(list(dYdt))
}
```

### Define Parameters

```{r}
beta <- 1/5
sigma <- 1/6
gamma <- 1/14

par<-c(beta,sigma,gamma)
```


## Solve Differential Equations

### `lsoda` function

```{r}
sol <- lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode, parms = par)

head(sol)
```

We'll return to this output in a second, but lets first take a deeper look at what is happening in `lsoda()`.

### What is going on under the hood?

```{r}
sol <- lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode, parms = par, verbose = T)
```

### How is `deSolve` doing the work?

Let's put in a few `print()` statements to help us learn.

```{r}
seir_ode_explore <- function(t,Y,par){
  
  print(str_c("S at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[1]))
  print(str_c("E at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[2]))
  print(str_c("I at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[3]))
  print(str_c("R at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[1]-Y[2]-Y[3]))

  S<-Y[1] # Suseptible
  E<-Y[2] # Exposed 
  I<-Y[3] # Infected
  
  beta<-par[1] # this takes the first slot from the vector par that is passed in - it changes every time
  sigma<-par[2] # this takes the second slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  gamma<-par[3] # this takes the third slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  
  dYdt<-vector(length=3)  ## this creates an empty vector of length 3
  dYdt[1]=-beta*I*S ## this is the formula for the suseptible population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[2]=beta*I*S-sigma*E ## this is the formula for the exposed population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[3]=sigma*E-gamma*I ## this is the formula for the infected population after the first step of the SEIR
  
  print(str_c("dSdt at time t = ", t," is: ", dYdt[1]))
  print(str_c("dEdt at time t = ", t," is: ", dYdt[2]))
  print(str_c("dIdt at time t = ", t," is: ", dYdt[3]))
  
  return(list(dYdt))
}
```

Lets see what this teaches us.

```{r}
t<-seq(0,1)

sol_explore<-lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode_explore, parms = par, verbose = F)
```

We can see from this output how `lsoda` is stepping through to numerically solve the differential equations.

## Explore Results

Results from `sol <- lsoda()`.

```{r}
head(sol)
```

### "Tidy" the output

This is confusing.  Let's clean it up.

```{r}

SEIR_Population <-
  sol %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(S = x1, E = x2, I = x3) %>%
  mutate(R = 1 - rowSums(.[2:4])) %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = S:R, .fns = ~ . * 10000))
  
head(SEIR_Population)
```

### Visualize Output

```{r}
SEIR_Population %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = S:R, names_to = "Bin", values_to = "Population") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Population, color = fct_relevel(Bin, "S", "E", "I", "R"))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x= "Time", y = "Population", color = "Bin")
```
